 Project Name
Embyr and the Magic Realm: A 2D Platformer


# Idea
My Idea was to create a 2D platformer game, with multiple types of enemies, animations, and collectibles. The way to win the game is to get past the enemies or defeat the enemies without dying, and Reach to the end goal.

Problem and solutions if found 
Many problems were found when I was working on my Player's magic blast. it took me more than 5 times to finally get the solution and fix the errors.


Future Work

I plan on working on 3D games next, or an RPG 2D game. I've only touched the surface of Game development and i cannot wait to start my future projects. Thank you to everyone at UniCODE and to the Mentors, Ahmad and Taleb.
